<p>On April 1st, 2011 chaos struck the MyBB Community forums, everything was..... Pirate?
</p><p>The staff decided, nothing wrong with a joke and changed the language pack on the community forum to a specially made pirate language pack (made by Tomm). Everyone saw everything in pirate language... Nothing was the same!
</p><p>The pirate pack lasted over 48hours to allow everyone in every timezone to get pranked. In addition, after popular demand, Tomm released his language pack as a public download, allowing anyone to change their forums language.
